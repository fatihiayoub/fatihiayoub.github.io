Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I am Ayoub. I am a Geomatics & Surveying Engineer with a deep-seated curiosity for the world and a fervor for learning.

I have dedicated my efforts to understanding and excelling in these research interests:

* Remote sensing: including hyperspectral imaging, object detection, and 3D reconstruction
* Machine learning and deep learning: for geo-spatial data, medical imaging, and natural language processing
* Software engineering: open-source, and Python

My true passion lies beyond, in the vast expanse of the cosmos. I'm an astronomy novice, constantly gazing at the stars, eager to unravel the mysteries of the universe.

Beyond my technical interests, I'm always ready to lend a helping hand or offer support wherever it's needed. Whether it's collaborating on exciting projects, sharing knowledge, or contributing to meaningful initiatives, I'm here to make a positive impact.
